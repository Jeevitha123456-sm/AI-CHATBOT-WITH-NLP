## How the script works:
An AI Chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate human conversation using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It can interact with users, understand their queries, and provide relevant responses. This chatbot will be built using NLP libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or spaCy, which help process and analyze text efficiently.

Objectives
The goal of this project is to:

Build a chatbot using NLTK or spaCy.
Enable the chatbot to process and understand user queries.
Provide relevant automated responses based on predefined rules or machine learning models.

Tools & Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python üêç
NLP Libraries:
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and text processing.
spaCy: Faster NLP processing and deep learning support.
Machine Learning (Optional): Training a chatbot with advanced AI models.

How the Chatbot Works
User Input Processing:
The chatbot takes user input in natural language.
It tokenizes and processes the text to extract key information.

Pattern Matching & Response Generation:
The chatbot matches the input with predefined patterns.
It generates responses using rule-based logic or an AI model.

User Interaction:
The chatbot continuously interacts with the user until the conversation ends.

Imports:
nltk: The main library for natural language processing.
random: For random responses.
nltk.chat.util.Chat: A utility class for creating a simple chatbot.
nltk.reflections: A set of predefined reflections (e.g., "I am" ‚Üí "you are").
Pairs: These are pairs of regular expressions and responses. The chatbot will match the user's input against these patterns and respond with the corresponding answer.

Chatbot: The Chat class takes the pattern-response pairs and reflections to create the chatbot.

Interaction: The chat() function allows the user to interact with the chatbot until they type 'Bye' to exit.

Running the script:
Install the necessary libraries using pip install nltk.
Run the script, and you can interact with the chatbot in the terminal or command prompt.
This is a basic chatbot that answers simple questions and responds to specific patterns. You can expand the patterns and responses to make the chatbot more intelligent.
