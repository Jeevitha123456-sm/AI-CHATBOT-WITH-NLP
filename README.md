## How the script works:
Imports:

nltk: The main library for natural language processing.
random: For random responses.
nltk.chat.util.Chat: A utility class for creating a simple chatbot.
nltk.reflections: A set of predefined reflections (e.g., "I am" â†’ "you are").
Pairs: These are pairs of regular expressions and responses. The chatbot will match the user's input against these patterns and respond with the corresponding answer.

Chatbot: The Chat class takes the pattern-response pairs and reflections to create the chatbot.

Interaction: The chat() function allows the user to interact with the chatbot until they type 'Bye' to exit.

Running the script:
Install the necessary libraries using pip install nltk.
Run the script, and you can interact with the chatbot in the terminal or command prompt.
This is a basic chatbot that answers simple questions and responds to specific patterns. You can expand the patterns and responses to make the chatbot more intelligent.
